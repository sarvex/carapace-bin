# Bridge

Bridging completions from another engine for shells not natively supported by it is possible with the corresponding [Macro](./macros.md).

> Even when the command supports your current shell it is still beneficial to bridge it as this enables [embedding](./embed.md) like `sudo [spec.name] <TAB>`.
>
> It also avoids the issue of [shell startup delay] when sourcing the completion in init scripts otherwise circumvented with [lazycomplete].
>
> However, bridging is limited to supported commands/frameworks and how well it actually works.
